## Project Description
Have you ever wondered how likely a meteorite is to blow up the earth?  
What are the chances of you spotting a meteor in your country?  
Which country do meteorites prefer to visit when they travel to earth?  
We will deepen into the NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset in order to answer this questions and decide wheter to panic or not ü§™

## Project Goals
We'd like to get some insights on the Meteorite Landings dataset so we can answer the following questions:
- What is the probability that a meteorite hits the earth?
- Which is the avereage frequency of meteorite landings per continent? Which country is in the top?
- Wich meteorite type is the more frequent to land?

## Data Workflow
In this project we focus on Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Visualization skills.
