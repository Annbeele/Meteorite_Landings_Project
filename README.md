## Project Description

Have you ever wondered **how many meteorites have fallen to Earth** and which one was the **heaviest**?

Which countries have suffered **more impacts**?

What is the **frequency of meteorite fall over time**?

*-We will deepen into the NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset and try to answer these questions (and some more) in a single visualization using Tableau-*


## Workflow
In this project we focus on Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Visualization skills.

### STEP 1. Data Wrangling
Data cleaning and data engineering using PYTHON  
- [Click to see the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Annbeele/Meteorite_Landings_Project/blob/main/Docs/Meteorite_Landings.ipynb)

### STEP 2. Tableau - Interactive Visualization
- [Click to see the Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anna.beteta/viz/Meteorite_Landings_Study/Dashboard1)

### STEP 3. - Conclusions
- Total mass and number of meteorites per countries are not correlated.
- The heaviest meteorite ever fallen to the Earth was 60.000kg and impacted in Namibia (Africa)
- Antarctica is the place where more meteorites were found
- Most meteorites fell/were found during the 21st century
