## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this project we focus on Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Visualization skills.



*Have you ever wondered ...*


- *How many meteorites have fallen to Earth and which one was the heaviest?*  
- *Which countries have suffered more impacts?*  
- *What is the frequency of meteorite fall over time?*


We will deepen into the NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset and try to answer these questions (and some more) in an interactive single visualization.

## WORKFLOW

#### STEP 1 - Data Wrangling
Data cleaning and data engineering using PYTHON  
- [See Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Annbeele/Meteorite_Landings_Project/blob/main/Docs/Meteorite_Landings.ipynb)

#### STEP 2 - Tableau: Interactive Visualization
- [See Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anna.beteta/viz/Meteorite_Landings_Study/Dashboard1)

#### STEP 3 - Conclusions
- Total mass and number of meteorites per countries are not correlated.
- The heaviest meteorite ever fallen to the Earth was 60.000kg and impacted in Namibia (Africa)
- Antarctica is the place where more meteorites were found
- Most meteorites fell/were found during the 21st century. That makes sense, as it is probably due to technological innovation and the growing concern to keep track of these records
