## Project Description

Have you ever wondered **how many meteorites have fallen to Earth** and which one was the **heaviest**?

Which countries have suffered **more impacts**?

What is the **frequency of meteorite fall over time**?

*-We will deepen into the NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset and try to answer these questions (and some more) in a single visualization using Tableau-*


## Workflow
In this project we focus on Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Visualization skills.

### STEP 1. Data Wrangling
Data cleaning and data engineering using PYTHON
- See Jupyter notebook:

### STEP 2. Tableau - Interactive Vizualization
- See Tableau Vizz:

### STEP 3. - Presentation
- See Slides:
